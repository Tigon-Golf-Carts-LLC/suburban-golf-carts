### Expert Knowledge Documentation

#### Golf Cart Technology and Applications
**Q: What types of golf carts do you specialize in?**
A: We specialize in electric golf carts and Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs) from two premier brands: DENAGO and Evolution. Our inventory includes recreational golf carts, street-legal LSVs, utility vehicles, and commercial fleet solutions. We carry over 35 different models ranging from 2-passenger personal carts to 8-passenger commercial vehicles.

**Q: What makes a golf cart street-legal in Delaware?**
A: Street-legal LSVs must meet DOT compliance standards including proper lighting (headlights, taillights, turn signals), safety equipment (seat belts, mirrors, windshield), and speed governors limiting top speed to 25 mph. They require Delaware DMV registration and can operate on roads with speed limits of 35 mph or less.

**Q: What's the difference between DENAGO and Evolution brands?**
A: DENAGO focuses on urban mobility and adventure-ready vehicles with models like the EV City for street-legal transportation and the Nomad series for off-road recreation. Evolution offers a broader range from classic golf course carts to high-performance D6 Max series and commercial utility vehicles like the Carrier and Turfman series.

#### Technical Specifications and Performance
**Q: What kind of battery life and range can I expect?**
A: Our electric vehicles typically offer 25-50 miles per charge depending on the model, terrain, and usage. Most use 48V or 72V lithium-ion or AGM battery systems with 6-8 hour charging times. Higher-end models offer fast-charging capabilities and extended range options.

**Q: How fast do golf carts go?**
A: Speed varies by model and intended use. Golf course carts typically reach 12-15 mph, while street-legal LSVs are governed at 25 mph for DOT compliance. Utility models may have variable speed settings optimized for work applications.

**Q: What's the load and towing capacity?**
A: Load capacity ranges from 800-1200 lbs depending on the model. Towing capacity varies from 500-1000 lbs. Commercial utility models like the Evolution Carrier series offer maximum cargo and towing capabilities for work applications.

#### Pricing and Financing
**Q: What do golf carts cost?**
A: Our pricing ranges from approximately $8,000 for entry-level models to $25,000+ for premium commercial vehicles. Popular models include the DENAGO EV City at $11,995, Evolution D5 Maverick 4 Plus at $12,995, and Evolution D6 Max XT4 at $16,995.

**Q: Do you offer financing?**
A: Yes, we provide flexible financing solutions including 0% financing on select models. We work with multiple financing partners to offer competitive rates and terms from 12-60 months. We also accept trade-ins and offer flexible down payment options.

#### Service and Maintenance
**Q: What kind of service do you provide?**
A: We offer comprehensive service including routine maintenance, repairs, warranty service, parts replacement, and mobile service. Our certified technicians specialize in DENAGO and Evolution vehicles and can handle everything from basic maintenance to major repairs and customizations.

**Q: How often do golf carts need maintenance?**
A: Electric golf carts require minimal maintenance compared to gas vehicles. Routine maintenance includes battery care, tire rotation, brake inspection, and annual safety checks. Most maintenance can be scheduled every 6-12 months depending on usage.

#### Geographic Coverage and Local Expertise
**Q: What areas do you serve in Delaware?**

### Question-Answer Training Pairs

#### Customer Service Interactions
**Customer:** "I'm looking for a golf cart for my beach house in Rehoboth. What would you recommend?"
**Response:** "For Rehoboth Beach use, I'd recommend either the DENAGO EV City if you want street-legal capability for local transportation, or the Evolution D5 Maverick 4 Plus for premium recreational use. The EV City at $11,995 is perfect for neighborhood transportation and short trips to town, while the Maverick at $12,995 offers superior comfort and features for beach property use. Both are electric, quiet, and perfect for the coastal environment."

**Customer:** "Can I use a golf cart on the roads in Delaware?"
**Response:** "Yes, but only street-legal Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs) that meet DOT requirements. These include proper lighting, safety equipment, and DMV registration. LSVs can operate on roads with speed limits of 35 mph or less. We carry several street-legal models including the DENAGO EV City and can help you with the registration process."

**Customer:** "What's included in your service packages?"
**Response:** "Our service packages include routine maintenance like battery care and inspection, tire rotation and pressure checks, brake system inspection, charging system testing, and annual safety inspections. We also offer mobile service for convenience, warranty repairs, and can customize vehicles with accessories and performance upgrades."

#### Technical Support Examples
**Customer:** "My golf cart isn't holding a charge like it used to."
**Response:** "Battery performance can decline over time or due to several factors. First, check if you're following proper charging procedures - fully charging after each use and avoiding deep discharge. Also check for corroded connections or damaged cables. If the batteries are 3-4 years old, they may need replacement. We offer battery testing and replacement services with warranties on new battery systems."

**Customer:** "What accessories can I add to my golf cart?"
**Response:** "We offer extensive customization options including weather enclosures, upgraded seating, lighting packages, sound systems, storage solutions, lift kits, custom wheels and tires, windshields, and utility accessories like toolboxes or cargo beds. We can also add street-legal equipment to convert recreational carts to LSV status where applicable."
